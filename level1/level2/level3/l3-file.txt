Descriptive: These paragraphs have four main aims. First of all, they naturally describe something or somebody, that is conveying the information. Secondly, such paragraphs create powerful images in the reader's mind. Thirdly, they appeal to the primary senses of vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, to get the maximum emotional response from the reader. And finally, they increase the dynamics of the text. Some grammar rules may be skipped in descriptive paragraphs, but only for the sake of imagery.
